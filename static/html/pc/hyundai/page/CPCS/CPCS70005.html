                            <p class="pt16">How to seek correction of credit information or credit eligibility information​</p>
                            <p class="pt16">Under the Privacy Act you have the right to make a complaint to us about an act or practice engaged in by us as a credit provider that may be a breach of Part IIIA of the Privacy Act (which deals with credit reporting) or the CR Code (a “Credit Privacy Complaint”).​</p>
                            <p class="tlt2">Complaints​</p>
                            <p class="pt16">We aim to ensure that credit information and credit eligibility information about you is accurate, up to date and complete. Amendment of information will be conducted upon written or verbal request from you. You can contact us on 02 83113998 or write to The Privacy Officer to do this.​</p>
                            ​<p class="pt16">If you make a Credit Privacy Complaint, you must specify the nature of the complaint. It may relate to personal information that has been destroyed or de-identified. We will not charge you for making or dealing with the complaint. Within 7 days we will give you a written notice that acknowledges the making of the complaint and sets out how we will deal with the complaint, and we will then investigate the complaint. If we think it is necessary we may consult with a CRB or another credit provider. After investigating the complaint we will within 30 days (or any longer period agreed by you in writing) give you a written notice setting out our decision.​</p>
